/**
 * An entity is composed from components. As such, it is essentially a collection object for components.
 * Sometimes, the entities in a game will mirror the actual characters and objects in the game, but this
 * is not necessary.
 *
 * <p>Components are simple value objects that contain data relevant to the entity. Entities
 * with similar functionality will have instances of the same components. So we might have
 * a position component</p>
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 *
 * class PositionComponent {
 *   public x:number;
 *   public y:number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * <p>All entities that have a position in the game world, will have an instance of the
 * position component. Systems operate on entities based on the components they have.</p>
