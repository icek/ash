# @ash.ts/ash
A Typescript port of [Ash Framework], an entity framework for game development 
by [Richard Lord]. This is the bundle package containing the following packages:

- [core](../core/README.md) - Core module.
- [fsm](../fsm/README.md) - Finite State Machine for Engine and Entities.
- [io](../io/README.md) - Serialization/Deserialization for Engine.
- [signals](../signals/README.md) - Signals used for internal communication.
- [tick](../tick/README.md) - Tick providers.
- [tools](../tools/README.md) - Optional tools for use with Ash.  

## Instalation

Using npm:

`npm i @ash.ts/ash`

Using yarn:
 
`yarn add @ash.ts/ash`

## Examples

- Asteroids (SVG version): [Demo][demo-svg] [Source][source-svg]
- Asteroids (PIXI.js version): [Demo][demo-pixi] [Source][source-pixi]

## Documentation

TypeDoc generated [API docs][api]

Richard Lord also written a few blog posts explaining how Ash works.

## Join the discussion (for AS3 version)

There is a [Google group for discussing Ash][group],
how to use it and how to make it better. 
Everyone who uses Ash or is interested in using Ash is welcome.

## Differences between typescript and AS3 version

As this is a port to a different language there are some changes to the API.

### Nodes

Javascript which is a language that typescript is compiling to, is dynamic. 
Variables that are declared but not yet instantiated doesn't have a type. 
In AS3 when Node fields are null but they are declared as some type, that
information is kept at runtime.
Adding typescript to javascript gave us code completion and type checking, 
but information about type is dropped as soon as code is compiled to javascript
and not available at runtime. All you need to add is `@keep(Class)` to each 
field of your node. This way type information is available in compile and 
runtime. Example:
 
 ```typescript
import { Node, keep } from '@ash.ts/ash';
import { Motion, Position } from '../components';

export class MovementNode extends Node {
  
  @keep(Position)
  public position!:Position;
  
  @keep(Motion)
  public motion!:Motion;
  
}

```
Exclamation mark used in this example is a non-null assertion operator.
If you use `"strict": true` or `"strictNullChecks": true` flags in your
`tsconfig.json` file, it's the way to silent compiler. You as a developer 
can guarantee that these values will never be null, because as soon as they
are created by the Engine they are filled with components.

### Systems

Base System class is declared as abstract class with these methods marked as 
required to be declared in an inherited class.
- `public abstract addToEngine(engine:Engine):void;`
- `public abstract removeFromEngine(engine:Engine):void;`
- `public abstract update(time:number):void;`  

Example usage:

```typescript
import { Engine, NodeList, System } from '@ash.ts/ash';
import { RenderNode } from '../nodes';

export class RenderSystem extends System {
  private nodes:NodeList<RenderNode> | null = null;

  constructor(public container:HTMLElement) {
    super();
  }

  public addToEngine(engine:Engine):void {
    this.nodes = engine.getNodeList(RenderNode);
    // some more logic
  }

  public update(time:number):void {
    for (let node = this.nodes!.head; node; node = node.next) {
      // update logic
    }
  }

  public removeFromEngine(engine:Engine):void {
    this.nodes = null;
    // some more logic
  }
}

```

### IO

This package provides (de)serialization of Engine. Because of how js handle 
types, you need to provide additional string to ClassType map. Eg.:

```typescript
import { JsonEngineCodec } from '@ash.ts/io';
import { Display, Position } from '../components';

const classMap = new Map();
classMap.set('Position', Position);
classMap.set('Display', Display);
// ... add other classes

const codec = new JsonEngineCodec(classMap);
```

Other way to create Map (array of [string, ClassType] tuples):

```typescript
const classMap = new Map([
  ['Position', Position],
  ['Display', Display],
  // ... other classes
]);
```

If you export all components in one file, you can use this method:

```typescript
import * as components from './components';

const map = new Map(
  Object
    .keys(components)
    .map(key => [key, components[key as keyof typeof components]])
);
```

If your components are more complex objects, remember to also add all used
Classes. Eg. if you use PIXI you might want to add DisplayObject class.

```typescript
map.set('PIXI.DisplayObject', PIXI.DisplayObject);
```

Second important difference is exported JSON format. It's similar but not the 
same. All object codecs return object that implements EncodedObject interface.
All use the same "value" key. AS3 version use different keys for different 
types.

Typescript exported json example:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "type": "Position",
  "value": ...
}
```

value can be any valid json, eg. array in ArrayObjectCodec, number, boolean or 
string in NativeObjectCodec or object in most other codecs.

### ListIteratingSystem

This utility class is also declared as abstract class with `updateNode` method
marked as required. There are also 2 optional callback methods that can be 
declared in an inherited class:
- `protected nodeAdded?:(node:Node) => void;`
- `protected nodeRemoved?:(node:Node) => void;`

Example usage:

```typescript
import { ListIteratingSystem } from '@ash.ts/ash';
import { MovementNode } from '../nodes';

export class MovementSystem extends ListIteratingSystem<MovementNode> {
  constructor() {
    super(MovementNode);
  }

  // required
  public updateNode(node:MovementNode, time:number):void {
    // update logic
  }
  
  // optional
  public nodeAdded = (node:MovementNode) => {
    // logic to execute when new node is added to the system
  };
  
  // optional
  public nodeRemoved = (node:MovementNode) => {
    // logic to execute when new node is removed from the system
  };
}

```

## Alternatives

These are alternative typescript ports you can find:

- [ash-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ash-ts) - Private source code. 
No docs, no examples, only core module. Components must inherit from the 
AshComponent class.
- [AshTS](https://github.com/MikeMnD/AshTS) - Not a node module, core package 
only.
