# @ash.ts/core

Core part of ash.ts - a Typescript port of [Ash Framework], 
an entity framework for game development by [Richard Lord]

## Instalation

Using npm:

`npm i @ash.ts/core`

Using yarn:
 
`yarn add @ash.ts/core`

## Differences between typescript and AS3 version

As this is a port to a different language there are some changes to the API.

### Nodes

Javascript which is a language that typescript is compiling to, is dynamic. 
Variables that are declared but not yet instantiated doesn't have a type. 
In AS3 when Node fields are null but they are declared as some type, that
information is kept at runtime.
Adding typescript to javascript gave us code completion and type checking, 
but information about type is dropped as soon as code is compiled to javascript
and not available at runtime. All you need to add is `@keep(Class)` to each 
field of your node. This way type information is available in compile and 
runtime. Example:
 
 ```typescript
import { Node, keep } from '@ash.ts/ash';
import { Motion, Position } from '../components';

export class MovementNode extends Node {
  
  @keep(Position)
  public position!:Position;
  
  @keep(Motion)
  public motion!:Motion;
  
}

```
Exclamation mark used in this example is a non-null assertion operator.
If you use `"strict": true` or `"strictNullChecks": true` flags in your
`tsconfig.json` file, it's the way to silent compiler. You as a developer 
can guarantee that these values will never be null, because as soon as they
are created by the Engine they are filled with components.

### Systems

Base System class is declared as abstract class with these methods marked as 
required to be declared in an inherited class.
- `public abstract addToEngine(engine:Engine):void;`
- `public abstract removeFromEngine(engine:Engine):void;`
- `public abstract update(time:number):void;`  

Example usage:

```typescript
import { Engine, NodeList, System } from '@ash.ts/ash';
import { RenderNode } from '../nodes';

export class RenderSystem extends System {
  private nodes:NodeList<RenderNode> | null = null;

  constructor(public container:HTMLElement) {
    super();
  }

  public addToEngine(engine:Engine):void {
    this.nodes = engine.getNodeList(RenderNode);
    // some more logic
  }

  public update(time:number):void {
    for (let node = this.nodes!.head; node; node = node.next) {
      // update logic
    }
  }

  public removeFromEngine(engine:Engine):void {
    this.nodes = null;
    // some more logic
  }
}

```
